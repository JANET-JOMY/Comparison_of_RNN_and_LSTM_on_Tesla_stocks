# Comparison_of_RNN_and_LSTM_on_Tesla_stocks
This project implements a comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict Tesla stock prices. Using historical stock price data sourced from Kaggle, the project explores time-series forecasting techniques, where the dataset spans from Tesla's IPO in 2010 to 2017.
