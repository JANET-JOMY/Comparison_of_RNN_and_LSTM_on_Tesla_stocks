# Comparison_of_RNN_and_LSTM_on_Tesla_stocks
This project implements a comparative analysis of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict Tesla stock prices. Using historical stock price data sourced from Kaggle, the project explores time-series forecasting techniques, where the dataset spans from Tesla's IPO in 2010 to 2017.<br>
Predicting stock prices has become increasingly crucial for investors and analysts focusing on negotiating the unstable financial markets. Investing in a group of assets is challenging since the financial market fluctuates, creating abnormalities in the trend. Therefore, using traditional machine learning, we cannot accurately capture the future asset trend and predict the values. In this current research paper, a comparative analysis of two deep learning architectures-Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is performed to forecast Tesla Inc.’s stock price movements. LSTM’s forecast aligns more closely with the actual data as compared to the basic RNN model. The models have been evaluated for performance in terms of MSE, RMSE, and R -square values. LSTM model achieved 0. .000551,0.023,0.941 values for the above metrics respectively.
